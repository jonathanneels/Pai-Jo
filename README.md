# Pai-Jo
Pai Sho is known in the world of Avatar as an important game. 
This version "Pai Jo" is based on MODERN Pai Sho, a registered version found 'once' on the Nickelodeon site. 
That version is no longer available through normal means, and it felt like a cultural loss.. 
That's why I've made this Git, to resurrect that marvelous little game.

Wat needs to be improved/added;
* AI is really random.
* The ability to play with other friends through the network (online).
* Save, load a game (json format suggested).
* Shown steps on the field (besides a color difference. Would be beneficial for color-blind people). 
* Last position log (for example in the chatfield). 
* lay-out more friendly for all screens (inc. zoom function).
* Other/more tile variations to choose from. The current tiles are the freely avaiable classic skudpaisho tiles.

Feel free to make a fork. Spread the word and share this game! Play versus the ai or on a tablet with other board game enthusiasts.
